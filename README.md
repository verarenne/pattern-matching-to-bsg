# pattern-matching-to-bsg
This repository provides a preprocessing step that extracts Pattern Matches from .CSV files outputted by the ARBIMON platform and converts the .CSV files full of Pattern Matching detections into a format compatible with the BSG model training pipeline, enabling direct model retraining without BSG portal annotation.
